# GameOfChance / DiceGame
##### *~ for Computer Programming 11 online course ~*

---

### Requirements:

> This assignment is to get you familiar with the fundamentals of using a GUI. You will create a game of chance, if you would like to create your own that is acceptable as long as it is done in Java FX.  If you are low on ideas you can make a simple dice game.  Create a points/money pool to bet with.  Then roll the first dice.  Show the value and then have the user guess if the second dice roll will be higher or lower.  Ties are losses.  Keep track of the points/money and allow them to keep playing continuously.  Make sure that user cannot click on buttons when they are not supposed to.  It is good practice to disable buttons until the user can be allowed to use them.
> By properly disabling buttons it should be impossible to break the program.
